## Mission
The mission of ResBaz is to promote the digital literacy emerging at the center of modern research. We do this by providing a forum for researchers to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate on digital research tools and skills.

## Values
ResBaz is committed to the following values:

- **Openness**: We believe that research should be open and accessible to everyone.

- **Collaboration**: We believe that the best research is done through collaboration.

- **Diversity and inclusion**: We believe that a diverse and inclusive community is essential for innovation.

## Governance

***TODO: this is wrong!!!***

ResBaz is governed by a small group of volunteers (the "steering committee") who are elected by the community. The steering committee is responsible for setting the overall direction of ResBaz and ensuring that it is managed in a responsible and transparent manner.
### Decision-making
ResBaz strives to make decisions in a consensus-based manner. However, if consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made by a majority vote of the board of directors.

### Communication
ResBaz communicates with the community through a variety of channels, including its website, mailing list, and social media. The board of directors is committed to keeping the community informed about the decisions that are being made and the progress that is being made.

### Funding
ResBaz is funded by a variety of sources, including individual donations, corporate sponsorships, and grants. The board of directors is responsible for ensuring that ResBaz's finances are managed in a responsible and transparent manner.

### Intellectual property
All intellectual property created by ResBaz is owned by the community. The board of directors is responsible for managing the community's intellectual property in a responsible and transparent manner.

### Termination
ResBaz may be terminated by a two-thirds vote of the board of directors. In the event of termination, the board of directors will be responsible for ensuring that the community's assets are transferred to a new organization that is committed to the mission of ResBaz.
